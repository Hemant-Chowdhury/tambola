### About the Game
Tambola, also known as Tombola, Indian Bingo or Housie is a popular game that is believed to be originated in Italy in early 1500s.

Each player must buy at least one ticket to enter a game. Tambola is played with Numbers (1-90) being called out one at a time and players striking out those Numbers on their Tickets.

Each ticket contains 27 spaces, arranged in nine columns by three rows. Each row contains five numbers and four blank spaces.
The first column contains numbers from 1 to 9, the second column numbers from 10 to 20, the third, 20 to 30 and so on up until the last column, which contains numbers from 81 to 90.
